👋 Hi, I'm Ahmet Ulku, a passionate web developer.

💻 Backend: .NET Core is my primary skill when it comes to server-side development. I have hands-on experience in building robust and scalable web applications using the .NET Core framework (ASPNET CORE MVC).

🌐 Frontend: I excel in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, crafting visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I have a strong command of Bootstrap, harnessing its powerful CSS framework to create responsive and mobile-first designs.

⚡️ Additional Interests: I'm particularly interested in React for building dynamic and interactive user experiences. Additionally, I'm well-versed in Node.js and Python, leveraging their capabilities for server-side development and data analysis.

🌱 Constantly learning and exploring new technologies, I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in web development.
